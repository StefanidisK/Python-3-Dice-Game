# Python Assignment 3: Dice Game

Create a dice game that "rolls" two dice (gets two random numbers between 1 and 6). If the numbers are different, then the sum is added to a total. If they are the same, then the sum is subtracted from the total. The player wins if their total reaches 100 before or at their 20th roll. When the game is over, your game should ask the user if they want to play again.

**Random Module
**
This code might be helpful:

```
import random
  die1 = random.randint(1,6)
  print(die1)
```

**Expected Output
**
Each turn should show your roll number, the dice values, and the newly calculated total

**It could look like this:
**

**Marks
**
5 marks - internal documentation/meaningful names

5 marks - clear instructions/output

10 marks - game works and repeats

Total: 20 marks
